    <!--About Information-->
    <h3>About Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
    <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo, Japan. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki, was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, a company that produced parts for fighter planes during World War II. This early exposure to aviation influenced Miyazaki's lifelong fascination with flying, a theme that recurs in many of his films.

Miyazaki's family moved frequently during his childhood due to the war. He developed a love for manga and animation at a young age, inspired by the works of Osamu Tezuka and Tetsuji Fukushima. Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School, where he began to seriously pursue his interest in animation.

In 1963, he graduated from Gakushuin University with a degree in political science and economics, but his passion for animation led him to join Toei Animation as an entry-level animator. This marked the beginning of his illustrious career in the animation industry.</p>
